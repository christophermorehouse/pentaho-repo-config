Version 2.1
2016-02-23 Christopher Morehouse
* Updated ConfigureRepositoryJob.kjb to not copy updated Tomcat startup files. Disabled hops to steps that copied updated Tomcat startup files. Starting 
in Pentaho 6.0, CATALINA_OPTS is set in the start-pentaho.bat/sh scripts with a new variable called DI_HOME. Updated tomcat scripts were overwritting the 
CATALINA_OPTS variable and DI_HOME was not getting set.
* Deleted engine/Tomcat Startup Scripts folder since this is no longer needed.

* Updated ReadFiles.ktr for MSSQL Server repository support.
* Updated ChangeFiles.ktr to use updated jackrabbit/repository.xml file. Changes in this file include MSSQL Server support and added Cluster Journal section.
* Added section for MSSQL Server for the hibernate.cfg.xml file within the ChangeFiles.ktr.
